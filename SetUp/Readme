# Eventually this should be handled by an automated install script.

# Install required python libraries:
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install python-can

# Edit /boot/config.txt to make sure the mcp2515 kernel driver is open:
# Add the following lines: 
dtparam=spi=on
dtoverlay=mcp2515-can0,oscillator=8000000,interrupt=25,spimaxfrequency=1000000

# Then restart the raspberry piï¼š
sudo reboot

# Download a file from github
curl --output Readme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thetimmorland/rkr-logger/master/SetUp/Readme
# /master/ is the branch of the repository
# /Setup/ is a directory path
# Readme is the file
